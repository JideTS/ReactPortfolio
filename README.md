## Description

Welcome to the repository of my professional portfolio showcasing my expertise as a technology consultant. This platform highlights my skill set and demonstrates the value I bring when collaborating with companies and organizations.

Utilizing an innovative workflow, I employed Figma AI plugins to seamlessly transform my design mockups into React components and subcomponents. By integrating logic and connections, I optimized the development process, significantly saving time while elevating consistency, interoperability, and code reusability.

Feel free to explore and gain insights into my capabilities, past, current and future projects.
